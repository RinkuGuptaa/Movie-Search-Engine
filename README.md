# Movie-Search-Engine

This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a movie search engine website. The HTML structure includes a header container, a form, and an image container. The CSS styles the elements, including a background image, bubble animation, and form styling. The bubble animation creates a rising effect for eight bubbles with different sizes and animations. The form includes a text input field and a search button, with animations for the input field and button. The JavaScript code loads an external script and the Typed.js library, which is used to create a typing animation for the text "Movie Search Engine" in the header. The animation types out the text with a speed of 150ms and loops indefinitely. The code also includes media queries for responsive design. All things contained, the code provides a basic structure and design for a movie search engine website, but lacks the functionality to perform actual searches and display results.
